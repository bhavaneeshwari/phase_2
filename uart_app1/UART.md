### AXI 
**Advanced eXtensible Interface** is a point to point interconnect that is designed  high performance, high speed microcontroller systems.
The AXI protocol is based on a point to point interconnect to avoid bus sharing and therefore allow higher bandwidth and lower latency.
There are three types of AXI4 interfaces:
◦-> AXI4-Lite—for simple, low-throughput memory-mapped communication, providing a**register-like structure** with reduced features and complexity (1 transfer per transaction)
◦-> AXI4—for high-performance memory-mapped requirements (up to 256 data transfers)
◦-> AXI4-Stream—for high-speed streaming data (unlimited amount of data)
The AXI specifications describe an interface between a single AXI master and a single AXI slave.
